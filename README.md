# Storybook with Expo Router v2, SDK 49 & TypeScript

- Working starter template that uses [`expo-router v2`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.
- It includes Storybook Web & Native configured with a few stories using TypeScript.
- You can update the .env file to disable or enable storybook on your app.
- It uses new features like Path Aliases, Opt out from package version validation, and client environment variables.

## üöÄ How to use

```sh
npm install

# Run on native
npm start

# Run on web
npm run storybook:web
```

If you want to disable storybook to work on your app, update the `.env` file like this:

```diff
EXPO_PUBLIC_STORYBOOK_ENABLED=false
```
